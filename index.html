        Earthquakes are a result of <b>tectonic plate shifting</b> under the surface of the earth. These plates, when
        moved, drag the part of crust around and if two plate scrape one another they produce powerful
        vibrations that can cause <b style="color: red">mass destruction</b>. These deadly vibrations are not
        only limited to the nature's wrath of tectonic shifting only, sometimes even rocks some man-made events can also
        cause major destruction. However, these events are quite tame when compared to EQ events.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 10px">
        This visualization aims to show the <b>intensity of the EQ events</b> against some other earth-shaking events,
        both <span style="color: green">natural</span> and <span style="color: magenta"> man-made</span>. We
        first take a look at all the events detected globally corresponding to the earth-shaking categories as follows,

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 10px">
                We have the events plotted over a globe according to the provided <b>latitude</b>
                and <b>longitude</b> values. In this visualization, the <a
                    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vega/datalib/master/test/data/world-110m.json">world-110m</a>
                map is used as the basemap, and the events are laid out over it. The visualization can be <i>rotated</i>
                to view the events at different positions on the globe.
                <br><br>
                On one hand, we have the events plotted where the event type is <b>anything but earthquake</b> and on
                the
                second depiction, we plot the event types that are of <b>earthquake</b> type. It is quite visible from
                the comparison that majority of the events recorded are of earthquake. Due to lesser number of events,
                the marker size for `other` event types has been increased.

            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 10px">
                Now that we know the frequency and trend of occurrences of the events in the data set, we can look at
                the <b>extent of magnitudes</b> of different event types, their mean value, and the outliers if any that
                exist for that specific category. From the box plots, we can see that the most outliers are in the
                <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">earthquake</span> category, no surprises here. We also
                observe that almost all the events have a mean <b>magnitude < 2</b>, except for both mining categories.
                <br><br>
                This visualization shows the power of the earthquake type events. Even though other natural events do
                exist that can cause destruction, but non comes close to the magnitude outliers of the earthquake type
                events.

                Finally, now we can try to visualize the <b>average</b> magnitude for the events. With the averaging
                included, the outliers now do not pose an issue for plotting axes.
                <br><br>
                The focus is on <b>monthly comparison</b> of average magnitude over the year between <b>2019</b> and <b>2020</b>.
                In accordance with the boxplot, we see that the <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold">earthquake</span>
                category has a mean value around 2. This tells us that even though the earthquake events have outlier
                magnitude values, but they're so <b>frequent</b> in lower magnitude that those values take over the mean
                of the ensemble.
                <br><br>
                This visualization provides an interactive legend which can be used to separate out the event type and
                their average monthly magnitude when selected.
